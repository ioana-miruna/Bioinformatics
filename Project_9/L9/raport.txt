Genomic Inverted Repeat Analysis Report (Transposon Motif Search)
Source Genomes:

Salmonella enterica LT2 (GCA_000006945.2)
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (GCA_000195955.2)
Streptococcus pneumoniae NCTC7465 (GCA_001457635.1)

I. Methodology and Limitations
The method used a custom Python algorithm to detect inverted repeats (IRs) as a proxy for TIRs flanking DNA transposons.

Search Parameters:
Genome Slice: First 10,000 base pairs of each genome.
Repeat Length (S1/S2): Minimum 4 bp, Maximum 6 bp.
Spacer Distance (Gap between S1 and S2): Minimum 5 bp, Maximum 50 bp.
Definition of a Match: Two sequences S1 and S2 form an IR provided S2 is the precise reverse complement of S1, and they are separated by a distance (spacer) in the specified range.

II. Executive Summary of Findings

In general, the search against all three bacterial genomes turned up a lot of short inverted repeat pairs. The motifs are frequent and relatively short; taken with the small spacer distance (5-50 bp), these observations suggest that most of these hits represent small, non-coding, structural elements, for instance, hairpin/stem-loop structures in regulatory regions, rather than full-length autonomous transposons.
The relative scarcity of IRs in M. tuberculosis compared to the other two species may be related to its high G+C content, a characteristic that often influences genome structure and repeat distribution.

III. Detailed Results by Organism

1. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica str. LT2

Key Findings: A moderate frequency of IRs was determined (5.3 hits/kbp). The IRs are diverse, with 25 unique repeat motifs accounting for the 53 total pairs.
Example Motifs: AGAG (Reverse Complement: CTCT), AGAT (Reverse Complement: ATCT).
Discussion: The occurrence of numerous short, discrete IRs is a common feature of bacterial genomes both in intergenic and coding regions and may be related to either transcriptional pausing or RNA stability elements.

2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

Key Findings: This genome had the fewest IR pairs detected-10 in total-and the lowest frequency, 1.0 hit/kbp. This difference is striking and probably reflects the unique composition of the M. tuberculosis genome.
Example Motifs: CGCAC (Reverse Complement: GTGCG), GGTTC (Reverse Complement: GAACC).
Discussion: The relative suppression of these small repeats may relate to mechanisms of genomic stability frequently found in bacteria of high G+C content, such as M. tuberculosis.

3. Streptococcus pneumoniae NCTC7465

Key Findings: This genome had the highest density of short IRs, 7.7 hits/kbp, indicating that the studied region is very repetitive or structurally complicated. The 34 unique motifs suggest a high diversity of possible stem-loop forming sequences.
Example Motifs: AGGTC (Reverse Complement: GACCT), TCAA (Reverse Complement: TTGA).
Interpretation: A high concentration of short IRs might suggest a region with extensive gene regulation, such as attenuation or riboswitches; alternatively, it might contain highly fragmented elements, including MITEs.

IV. Conclusion and Recommendations

The short, perfectly matched IRs detected are in concordance with the signature of TIRs, which constitute boundaries of transposons. But due to their short length (4-6 bp) and proximity (5-50 bp spacer), it is highly likely that they represent non-mobile, functional genomic structures and not big functional bodies of transposons.
Further analysis to confirm the presence of full-scale transposons is by:
Relax Spacer Constraint - Re-run the analysis with a far larger maximum spacer distance, to find TIRs flanking an entire gene or element. For example 500 bp to 2000 bp Search for DRs: Check the immediate vicinity of the detected IR pairs for short DRs, which are Target Site Duplications appearing as a hallmark when the insertion of a transposon takes place. Protein Search: Examine the sequence between the TIRs for a gene that encodes a transposase protein, which would be definitive evidence of a functional mobile element.
