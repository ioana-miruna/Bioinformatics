Main problem with this algorithmic approach:

This naive method of rebuilding a DNA sequence from random fragments simply concatenates
samples in arbitrary order, without considering overlaps, sequencing errors, or coverage depth.
In real genome assembly, algorithms must:
  - Identify overlaps between fragments (reads),
  - Resolve repeats and ambiguous regions,
  - Handle sequencing errors,
  - Build consensus sequences using graph-based methods (e.g., de Bruijn graphs).

Without these steps, the reconstruction is meaningless and will not resemble the original DNA.
